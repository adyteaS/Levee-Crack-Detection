# Levee-Crack-Detection
A repo for my IEEE paper

Working on making the code more readable. Until then, the entire data and code can be downloaded from my professor, Dr. Hoque's website: http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software.html under "Detection of Levee Crack from Images".
This paper has been accepted at the IEEE IGARSS 2020 conference from Sept 26th to Oct 2nd.
